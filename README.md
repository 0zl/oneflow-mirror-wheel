# Why?
Ugh, I need OneFlow with CPU and GPU support for cu116, but they haven't even released it on PyPI. What am I supposed to do, re-compile every colab restart?

I tried downloading it from their server on Aliyun, but the speed was slower than a snail with a hangover. I'm just trying to generate some dark-skinned diffusion waifus here!

But fear not, for I have found a solution. I'm mirroring a wheel to Github faster than Sonic on Red Bull. Thanks to some hacky-tacky Google Colab internet speed, I can now download the wheel straight from CN to US without needing a visa. Who needs OneFlow's slow server when you have my 1337 skills?
